-- Simplify chat_members INSERT policy to avoid infinite recursion
-- We'll make it more permissive for now to allow chat creation

-- Drop existing INSERT policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join chats" ON chat_members;

-- Create a very simple INSERT policy that allows authenticated users to add members
-- This is more permissive but will allow the chat creation to work
CREATE POLICY "Users can join chats" ON chat_members FOR INSERT

  auth.uid() IS NULL OR
  -- Allow any authenticated user to add members (more permissive for now)
